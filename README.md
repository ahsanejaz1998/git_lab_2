# git_lab_2

This repository contains contents of our lab2 for the AIDI 2000 course.

In this repo, we were asked to upload a logistic regression model in github using git. 

Similarly, i implemented a decision tree model which lacked in accuracy as compared to the logistic regression model.

The second model is uploaded in the new_branch
